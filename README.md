- Wildfire prediction system
- Contributors: Kaylee Pham, David Shin, Saulo Rubio, Sergio Ramirez, Tyler Poplawski, Macoto Ward, Lior Zlotikman
- Collect remote sensing data from The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), and California fire incident report from CALFIRE. Apply
data cleaning, clipping, extraction, interpolation, and
data intergration to create a new dataset for wildfire
prediction in California. Use Neural Networks, Support
Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for prediction. Use classification metrics,
cross-validation, and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
Coding in Python.
