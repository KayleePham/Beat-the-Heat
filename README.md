- Wildfire prediction system
- Contributors: Kaylee Pham, David Shin, Saulo Rubio, Sergio Ramirez, Tyler Poplawski, Macoto Ward, Lior Zlotikman
- Collect remote sensing data from The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Apply
data cleaning, clipping, interpolation, extrapolation, and
data extraction to create a new dataset for wildfire
prediction in California. Use Neural Networks, Support
Vector Machine for prediction. Use classification metrics,
cross-validation, and regularization for model evaluation.
Coding in Python.
